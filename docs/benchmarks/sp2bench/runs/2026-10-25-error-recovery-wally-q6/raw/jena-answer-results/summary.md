Memory: the servers' resident set (VmRSS, and VmHWM for peaks) and each load's peak RSS (GNU time). Lower is better.

| memory | jena-fuseki |
|---|---:|
| server RSS 2 s after start, before any query (MiB) | 270 |
| server RSS after every query ran once (MiB) | 4049 |

Memory per query: how far the server's peak RSS rose over its RSS before the request, then the peak, in MiB. The peak is reset (clear_refs) before each request of the answer check.
