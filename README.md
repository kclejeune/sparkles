# Sparkles

A high-performance RDF / SPARQL / OWL database in Rust. It aims to be a
**functional re-implementation of [Apache Jena](https://jena.apache.org/) + Fuseki**
(same protocols, same semantics, same operational model), built on the
**index and execution architecture of [QLever](https://github.com/ad-freiburg/qlever)**.
It also ships a SvelteKit UI for database management, graph visualization and
interactive querying.

* `docs/AUDIT.md` covers the Jena and QLever audits and the language decision (Rust vs. Go).
* `docs/API.md` is the HTTP API contract (Fuseki-compatible, plus `/$/` extensions).

## Philosophy

1. **Jena-compatible where users can see it.** The goal is that anything talking to
   Fuseki keeps working: the SPARQL 1.1 Query/Update/Graph Store protocols, Fuseki
   endpoint names (`/{ds}/sparql|query|update|data|get|upload`), the `/$/` admin API,
   RDF formats, result formats, dataset semantics (default + named graphs, optional
   union default graph), and TDB2's operational model (bulk load, transactions,
   compaction, backups).
2. **QLever-style internals where performance lives.** Terms are dictionary-encoded
   into 64-bit tagged ids with inline literals. Indexes are fully sorted, compressed
   permutation files. Execution is column-at-a-time with a cost-based DP planner.
3. **Reuse the Rust RDF ecosystem.** We don't re-implement parsers that already
   exist: `oxrdf`, `oxttl`, `oxrdfxml`, `oxjsonld`, `spargebra`, `sparesults` and
   `oxsdatatypes` from the Oxigraph project supply the term model, parsers, SPARQL
   algebra and XSD value space. Sparkles provides the storage, planner, executor,
   server, reasoner and UI.
4. **Library first.** `crates/sparkles` is an embeddable engine with no HTTP or async
   dependencies (Jena `core`/`arq`/`tdb2`). The server (`sparkles-server`, the Fuseki
   equivalent) and the reasoner are separate crates built on its public API.

## Layout

| Path | Role | Jena analogue |
|---|---|---|
| `crates/sparkles` | ids, vocabulary, permutation index, bulk builder, store (MVCC + WAL), SPARQL engine, RDF I/O | jena-core, jena-arq, jena-tdb2, jena-db |
| `crates/sparkles-reasoner` | RDFS / OWL 2 RL / Jena rule syntax, forward chaining *(planned)* | jena-core `reasoner` |
| `crates/sparkles-server` | axum HTTP server + `sparkles` CLI | jena-fuseki2, jena-cmds |
| `ui/` | SvelteKit management / query / graph-exploration UI *(in progress)* | jena-fuseki-ui |

## Notable optimizations adopted from QLever

* **Ids with inline values.** The top 4 bits hold a tag and the low 60 bits a payload.
  UNDEF is 0, so it sorts first. Numbers and booleans never touch the dictionary.
* **Sorted vocabulary.** Id order equals term order, so prefix and range restrictions
  become id ranges (`Vocab::prefix_range`).
* **Permutation files.** Blocks store columns separately (delta + zig-zag varint +
  LZ4). Each block's first and last key stays in RAM, which enables block skipping
  for bound prefixes and exact counts with at most two block decodes.
* **Bulk build pipeline.** Parallel chunked parsing feeds per-batch partial
  vocabularies. These are k-way merged into a global vocabulary, ids are remapped in
  parallel, and each permutation is built with a parallel sort (or sorted runs plus a
  k-way merge when the data exceeds the memory budget).
* **Immutable base plus delta.** Updates are layered on the immutable index, in the
  style of QLever's `DeltaTriples`. Snapshots are versioned, and caches are keyed
  by snapshot version.
* **Columnar execution and planning.** Execution is column-major; the planner is a DP
  over interesting sort orders with a greedy fallback. Merge joins run on sorted
  scans.
* **Decoded-block cache.** A shared cache of decoded blocks, weighted by bytes.
* **Planner details.** Filters are placed as soon as their variables are bound. Scan
  sizes are exact from block metadata (at most two block decodes). Join estimates use
  per-predicate distinct subject/object statistics with QLever's 0.7 correction factor.
  Merge joins use galloping for skewed inputs. `COUNT(*)` over a single pattern is
  answered from index metadata. Transitive paths traverse from the bound side (index
  lookups per frontier node) instead of materializing the closure.
* **Executed-plan feedback.** Every query returns a runtime-information tree
  (estimated vs. actual rows, time per operator), like `qlever-json`. The UI renders it.

## Divergences from Jena / QLever (decisions)

| Decision | Rationale |
|---|---|
| Rust instead of Java/C++ | See `docs/AUDIT.md` §3: `spargebra`, `oxttl` and friends provide the parser and format stack; there is no GC, and performance is predictable. |
| Sorted-block permutations instead of TDB2's B+trees | Scan-heavy analytics are much faster and the files are smaller. Updates go into a delta that is periodically compacted, rather than being done in place. |
| Values are inlined only when the lexical form is canonical | QLever inlines lossily (doubles lose 4 bits, and the lexical form is dropped). Sparkles keeps exact RDF term identity (`"01"^^xsd:integer` ≠ `"1"^^xsd:integer`), as Jena does. Doubles whose low mantissa bits are nonzero go to the vocabulary. |
| Graph stored as a 4th key column in every permutation, plus a GSPO permutation | This matches QLever's graph column. GSPO gives TDB2-style graph-scoped access (dumps, `GRAPH ?g {}` enumeration). |
| Deltas held as persistent ordered sets (`imbl`) and WAL-logged | Gives O(1) snapshot publication for MVCC. QLever locates delta triples per block instead; we may adopt that later. |
| Blank nodes are stored ids and serialize as `_:b<hex>` | Labels round-trip through the protocol, like Jena's `<_:…>` handling. |
| LZ4 instead of zstd for blocks; front coding instead of FSST for the vocabulary | Pure-Rust dependencies and very fast decoding. zstd/FSST remain a possible upgrade for compression ratio. |
| RDF 1.2 triple terms not yet supported | They are not supported in the id space yet. `spargebra`/`oxrdf` support them behind the `rdf-12`/`sparql-12` features, and enabling those is planned. |
| Canonical decimal output follows XSD 1.1 (`"4"^^xsd:decimal`), whereas Jena writes `"4.0"` | Comes from `oxsdatatypes`; the values are equal, so value-based result comparison is unaffected. |
| SPARQL parsing and algebra via `spargebra` instead of a port of ARQ's JavaCC grammar | The algebra matches SPARQL 1.1 §18. ARQ syntax extensions (LET, `apf:` property functions, custom aggregates) are not supported. |
| Filter placement and equality substitution happen in the planner rather than as ARQ-style algebra transforms | Same effect as `TransformFilterPlacement` / `TransformFilterEquality`, with one less pass over the algebra. |
| `REDUCED` is a no-op | Allowed by the spec. |
| `GRAPH ?g { P }` binds `?g` as a scan column when `P` is a plain join group; otherwise `P` is evaluated per named graph and joined with `?g`, like Jena's `OpGraph` | The fast path covers the common case, and the fallback keeps SPARQL scoping exact (e.g. OPTIONAL or MINUS inside GRAPH). |
| `GROUP_CONCAT` always returns a simple literal | Spec behaviour; Jena keeps a common language tag. |
| Out of scope for v1 | JS scripting functions, RDF Thrift/Protobuf/TriX, jena-ontapi object mapping, jena-text, GeoSPARQL, ShEx, RDF Patch, backward-chaining (LP) rules, Shiro auth. |

## Building & running

```sh
pnpm -C ui install && pnpm -C ui build        # optional: the UI is embedded at compile time
cargo build --release
./target/release/sparkles serve --data ./data --port 3030   # UI at http://localhost:3030/ui/
```

Fuseki-style endpoints for a dataset `ds`: `/ds/sparql`, `/ds/update`, `/ds/data` (GSP),
`/ds/upload`, plus `/$/datasets`, `/$/stats/ds`, `/$/compact/ds`, `/$/backup/ds`, `/$/tasks`
(see `docs/API.md`). `--mem NAME` adds an in-memory dataset, `--loc NAME=PATH` serves an
existing database.

Command line tools (Jena `tdb2.*` / `arq` equivalents):

```sh
sparkles load    --loc db data/*.ttl.gz       # parallel bulk load (tdb2.tdbloader)
sparkles query   --loc db 'SELECT ...'        # --results text|json|xml|csv|tsv, --explain, --time
sparkles query   --data file.ttl --query q.rq # query files in memory (arq --data)
sparkles update  --loc db 'INSERT DATA {...}'
sparkles compact --loc db                     # merge updates into a new generation
sparkles dump    --loc db > dump.nq
sparkles backup  --loc db --out backups/
sparkles stats   --loc db
sparkles infer   --loc db --profile owl-rl    # materialize inferences
```

`scripts/gen-data.py N` generates a synthetic dataset for benchmarking.

## Testing

```sh
cargo test --workspace
```

`crates/sparkles/tests/w3c.rs` runs the W3C SPARQL 1.0 / 1.1 query and update suites that
are vendored in the Apache Jena checkout (`../../apache/jena` next to this repository, or
`SPARKLES_W3C_DIR`). Known failures are listed in `crates/sparkles/tests/w3c-known-failures.txt`.
