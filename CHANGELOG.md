## Unreleased

### Format

Checked migration state in `.migrate-checked` uses JSON format 1. It records the cleanup
mode and exact old sibling directory so recovery by a later release preserves unrelated
kept copies. Unknown formats, malformed markers and bare legacy mode markers refuse
automatic recovery without changing the migration copies. Bare legacy state requires
inspection of the original directories and manual recovery or restore.

Runtime model secrets are sealed by default in builds with the default `backup` feature.
The first start seals existing plaintext values and generates `secrets.key` if no key
source was configured. Older releases require offline `sparkles secrets unseal --data
DIR` before downgrade. A data directory owned by another user needs `--secrets-key
SOURCE` or `--secrets-key none` until ownership is corrected. The format registry now
records the existing sealed v1 envelope and raw generated key without changing their
bytes or requiring a dataset migration. Unknown envelope versions are refused.
