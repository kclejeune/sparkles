## Unreleased

### Format

Checked migration state in `.migrate-checked` uses JSON format 1. It records the cleanup
mode and exact old sibling directory so recovery by a later release preserves unrelated
kept copies. Unknown formats, malformed markers and bare legacy mode markers refuse
automatic recovery without changing the migration copies. Bare legacy state requires
inspection of the original directories and manual recovery or restore.
