## Unreleased

### Changed

The server's query memory pool is on by default. It holds half of the memory the process
may use, less the configured caches, and at least 256 MiB. Each query and update request
reserves 16 MiB when it is admitted, so a host whose pool sits at the 256 MiB floor serves
at most 16 concurrent queries and updates. Further requests wait for
`--query-admission-wait` and then answer `503` with `Retry-After`.
`--total-query-memory-mb 0` turns the pool off.

`--cache-mb`, `--result-cache-mb`, `--service-cache-mb` and `--history-cache-mb` now size
one cache for the whole server instead of one per dataset. The default result cache fell
from 512 MiB to 256 MiB and the default history cache from 1 GiB to 512 MiB.
`StoreOptions::default` takes the same result and history sizes, which changes the
defaults for library users. `--memory-profile small` sets smaller sizes for constrained
hosts.

`sparkles migrate --check` exits 1 for a database with an interrupted run, which a server
refuses until `sparkles migrate` runs without `--check`, and its JSON report adds `opens`.
`sparkles migrate` keeps the mode and owner of every file it copies, and it must run as
the database's owner or as root.

### Format

Checked migration state in `.migrate-checked` uses JSON format 1. It records the cleanup
mode and exact old sibling directory so recovery by a later release preserves unrelated
kept copies. Unknown formats, malformed markers and bare legacy mode markers refuse
automatic recovery without changing the migration copies. Bare legacy state requires
inspection of the original directories and manual recovery or restore.

Runtime model secrets are sealed by default in builds with the default `backup` feature.
The first start seals existing plaintext values and generates `secrets.key` if no key
source was configured. Older releases require offline `sparkles secrets unseal --data
DIR` before downgrade. A data directory owned by another user needs `--secrets-key
SOURCE` or `--secrets-key none` until ownership is corrected. The format registry now
records the existing sealed v1 envelope and raw generated key without changing their
bytes or requiring a dataset migration. Unknown envelope versions are refused.
